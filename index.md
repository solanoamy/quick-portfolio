## About Me
  I'm an analyst focused on data-driven decision making that improves equity and quality of life in our cities. I'm experienced in identifying spatial and temporal trends from data and applying the appropriate models and tests for further insight.

  My primary interests are transportation, accessibility, and education.

### Projects

[Aligning Educational Research Using Matriculation Forecasts](http://example.com/)

This project sought to improve how Washington DC's public school system (DCPS) predicts enrollment for elementary schools in order to more effectively allocate resources to schools with greater need. I led modeling and co-led dashboard creation for this group project. Modeling included constructing a panel from 10 years of student data, census data, housing data, and engineered spatial features and testing linear and tree-based models. Once we selected a linear model, the dashboard was created to display enrollment predictions 5 years into the future. For more information about modeling, please see our [final report to DME](https://pennmusa.github.io/MUSA_801.io/project_41/DCED.html) outlining the process. Additionally, the [project dashboard](https://jasmine-404.github.io/DME-Enrollment-Dashboard/) is publicly available.

[Clear Paths PHL](https://solanoamy.github.io/engagement-project/)

Clear Paths PHL is a concept navigation app to improve pedestrian safety in Philadelphia, particularly for people with limited mobility and vision. It generates a walking route and displays potential obstructions, such as santiation schedules, historical parking violation data, and the locations of missing curb ramps that the user may come across. There is also a user reporting system where users can report any obstructions they come across. User reporting feature is no longer functional as it requires maintenance of a cloud database, and the project was created for a JavaScript class. Future iterations of the app would include route generation that minimizes encounters with obstructions and robust voice features.

[Making Predictions with Growhere](musa-580-final_2024-12-13.html)

Growhere is a concept tool for investors to predict which areas of Philadelphia will have the most growth in the future years, meant to inform investment. The project used a logistic regression to generate probabilities to later be used to estimate how many permits will be issued in a particular cell, with permits used as indicators of development. For more information on methods and results, [see the Growhere report](musa-580-final_2024-12-13.html).

### Other Data Visualizations

[Warehouse Map](https://github.com/solanoamy/30DayMap24/blob/main/scripts/12-amy.R)

This standalone map visualizes the increased footprint of warehouses in the Inland Empire over a ten-year period, highlighting their prevalence in disadvantaged areas. These disadvantaged areas are at increased risk of the harms of pollutants associated with the increased trucking in these areas, such as diesel particulate matter.
